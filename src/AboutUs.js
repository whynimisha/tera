        <h1>🌍 About TERRA</h1>
        <p>
          At <strong>TERRA</strong>, we believe that fashion should not cost the Earth.
          Our mission is to promote a sustainable lifestyle by guiding people to make
          conscious clothing choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          We connect eco-conscious consumers with ethical brands, promote recycling and
          upcycling of garments, and reward actions that reduce textile waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're here to learn, shop, donate, or get inspired, we thank you for
          supporting a cleaner, greener planet—one outfit at a time.
        </p>
